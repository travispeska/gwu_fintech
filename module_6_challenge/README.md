## Background

Proptech, the application of technology to real-estate markets, is an innovative domain in the fintech industry. Assume that youâ€™re an analyst at a proptech company that wants to offer an instant, one-click service for people to buy properties and then rent them. The company wants to have a trial of this offering in the San Francisco real-estate market. If the service proves popular, they can then expand to other markets.
