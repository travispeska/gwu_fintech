## Background
A fintech startup company has recently hired me. This company is disrupting the finance industry with its own cross-border, Ethereum-compatible blockchain that connects financial institutions. Currently, the team is building smart contracts to automate many of the institutions’ financial processes and features, such as hosting joint savings accounts.

To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, I've created a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. My smart contract uses ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.
