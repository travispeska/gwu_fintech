## Financial Planning Tools

This Jupyter Notebook uses two financial planning tools:

1. Financial Planner for Emergencies
2. Financial Planner for Retirement

### Visualizations

Vizualizations aren't used for emergency fund planning.

For retirement planning, we use two Monte Carlo simulations to forecast potential portfolio earnings over 30 years when weighted 40% bonds 60% stocks and over 10 years when weighted 20% bonds and 60% stocks.
