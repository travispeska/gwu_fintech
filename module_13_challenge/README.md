## Background

As a risk management associate at Alphabet Soup, a venture capital firm. I have created a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

I was supplied a list of 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup in the past. The list also contains a variety of information about each business, including whether or not they ultimately became successful. Using machine learning and neural networks, I have created a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business.
