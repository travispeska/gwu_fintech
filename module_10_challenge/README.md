## Background
As financial advisors, we are proposing a novel approach to assembling investment portfolios based on cryptocurrencies.  This project's Jupyter notebook will cluster cryptocurrencies by their performance in different time periods. Then it plots the results so that performance can be analyzed visually.

Summary of Jupyter notebook:
1. Data is Imported and Prepared
2. Find the Best Value for k
3. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means
4. Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis
5. Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
6. Cluster the Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data
7. Visualize and Compare the Results
