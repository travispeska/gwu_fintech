## Background
I’ve been hired as a digital transformation consultant by one of the most prominent retirement plan providers in the country. They want to increase their client portfolio—especially by engaging young people. Because machine learning and NLP are disrupting finance to improve the customer experience, I have decided to create a robo advisor. Both existing and potentially new customers will be able to use this robo advisor to get investment portfolio recommendations for retirement.

## Technologies
1. Facebook Page: The interface which makes the Robo Advisor accessible to users
2. AWS Lex: Creates the intent, accepts input and returns outputs
3. AWS Lambda: The core functionality that processes input from Lex and returns results to Lex
4.
