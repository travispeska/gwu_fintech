## Background

In this Challenge, we assume the role of a financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world. Our firm constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. In recent years, the firm has heavily profited by using computer algorithms that can buy and sell faster than human trader.  
  
The speed of these transactions gave our firm a competitive advantage early on, but people still need to specifically program these systems, which limits their ability to adapt to new data. We're planning to improve the existing algorithmic trading systems and maintain the firm’s competitive advantage in the market. To do so, we’ll enhance the existing trading signals with machine learning algorithms that can adapt to new data.
