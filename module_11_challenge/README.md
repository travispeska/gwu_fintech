This repository contains the Jupyer Notebook and data (in CSV format) needed to prepare, analyze, and vizualize interesting patterns and predictions which can be used to identify potential areas of growth for our company, [MercadoLibre](https://investor.mercadolibre.com/investor-relations).

Using this notebook, we will perform the following:
1. Find unusual patterns in hourly Google search traffic
2. Mine the search traffic data for seasonality
3. Relate the search traffic to stock price patterns
4. Create a time series model with Prophet
5. Forecast revenue by using time series models
