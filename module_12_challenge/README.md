## Background
Credit risk poses a classification problem thatâ€™s inherently imbalanced. This is because healthy loans easily outnumber risky loans. In this Challenge, I use various techniques to train and evaluate models with imbalanced classes. I began with a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. Then I used oversampling to increase the size of the minority to build a second,
more accurate, model.
